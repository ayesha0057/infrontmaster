  <h4>
  Our Story
  </h4>
  <p>
  nfront's seeds were planted when Andy Meng moved to Colorado Springs in October 1994 to found a company
   called Data Made Accessible with his brother. One of the company's first projects was a simple website that 
   indexed agricultural research documents and made them available to U.S. 
  Department of Agriculture field agents through the world wide web.
  </p>
  <p>
  From the humble beginnings of this simple website, this Colorado Springs website design company grew to a team 
  specialized in creating data driven websites. In 1999, Andy bought the assets of DMA and Timberline Webworks was born. Timberline grew during the dot-com boom and became Infront Webworks in 2000. Despite the negative economic effects post-9/11/2001, Infront Webworks thrived and
   began to hone its areas of expertise in: website architecture, web design, development, SEO, marketing & cloud services.
  </p>
  <p>

  In April of 2012, Infront's reins were handed over to its new CEO and owner Matthew Palis, an Internet veteran with more 
  than 20 years of experience in running web development, SEO, online marketing, and cloud services companies. In June 2013,
   Infront moved "uptown" in Colorado Springs and continues
   to serve its worldwide client base from an office designed to promote collaboration amongst team members and clients.
